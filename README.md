# Cryptocurrency Trading Strategies and Predictions

This repository contains Python scripts for implementing various cryptocurrency trading strategies and predictive models. These scripts leverage popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, ta, sklearn, and matplotlib to analyze historical cryptocurrency data and make predictions about future price movements. Below is an overview of the contents of this repository:

## Features

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: Load historical cryptocurrency data from CSV files, preprocess the data, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Pattern Detection**: Detect bullish and bearish engulfing patterns in the data.
3. **Strategy Returns and Metrics**: Compute strategy returns and various performance metrics including Sortino Ratio, Beta Ratio, CAPM Metric, and Maximum Drawdown.
4. **Support and Resistance Trading Strategy**: Implement a trading strategy based on RSI and SMA indicators, generate trading signals for buying and selling.
5. **Scalping Trading Strategy**: Define a scalping trading strategy based on RSI and SMA indicators.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Predict average price for the next 24 hours, set support and resistance levels, implement momentum-based prediction strategy, and utilize Random Forest Regressor for advanced price prediction.
7. **Visualization**: Plot closing prices, predicted prices, support and resistance levels, and the next 24 hours prediction window for visualization purposes.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/slimaninasreddine/Cryptocurrency-Trading-Strategies-and-Predictions.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Scripts**: Explore the scripts in the repository and run them using Python. You may need to provide your own cryptocurrency data files for analysis.
